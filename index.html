            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
            brought to life through exhibits.
          </h1>
          <p>
            This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied
            subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed
            for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life
            (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night
            when everyone’s gone home).

              <p>
                On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the
                Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum.
                It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience
                the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy
                powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are
                able to use and control wind to create power.
