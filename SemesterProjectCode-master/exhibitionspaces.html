            <p class="cursive">Explore the wonders of our cosmos</p>
            <p>
              Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night
              sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
              We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be
              seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars
              to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from
              early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest
              exploration of the planets in our solar system.

            <h3>Evolution</h3>
            <p class="cursive">
              Where do we come from and how did we get here?
            </p>
            <p>
              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with this
              question of our origins. Since Darwin proposed his theory of
              evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding
              our place in this world. Discover the origins of life on this
              planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time.
              You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who
              didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a
              number of dinosaurs too.

            <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
            <p class="cursive">
              Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from
              the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
            </p>
            <p>
              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
              biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
              the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much
              longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
              growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits
              we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major
              breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first
              heart transplant.

            <h3>Robotics and AI</h3>
            <p class="cursive">Meet Rob the Robot and make a new friend!</p>
            <p>
              The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
              intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
              applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
              here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

            <h3>Ecology</h3>
            <p class="cursive">
              In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
              currently face including global warming, extinction of species,
              and pollution.
            </p>
            <p>
              But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a
              brighter future. As we learn more and more of the impact humans
              are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that
              scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for
              humans but for the whole planet.
